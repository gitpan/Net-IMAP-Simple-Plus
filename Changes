   - This might fix the darwin build problems.  I think the silly
     pure perl version of patch I'm distributing (thank you CWEST
     btw) was expecting darwin to do something it didn't want to
     do ... I use unlink() excessively to solve this problem
     (theoretically).

   - Corion gave me starttls() to include and suggested I apply
     for co-maintainership.
   - I introduced bugs in 002 ... fixed
   - fixed a useless use of hash bug (??) by changing
     write($self->{debug}, $line) to
     print {$self->{debug}} $line.  Odd.

   - I altered the docs very slightly, not enough to release
     anything (yet)

   - added flags() and gave put() flag capability

   - I decided I need a Plus.pm file so things show up right in
     CPAN.  I might want to do more updates...

   - I'm tired of waiting for those guys, I applied my patches
     and I'm releasing it to CPAN.  For all I know they never
     heard from me, but what else can I do RT and email is the
     most I can reasonably do.  -Paul
