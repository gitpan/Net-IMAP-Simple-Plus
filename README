This is nothing more than the Net-IMAP-Simple-1.17.tar.gz distribution with a
few patches applied.  I wanted put() and I wanted unseen() and the three
maintainers listed in the docs are blackholes.

If you'd like to put() messages and check to see how many are unseen() and
you'd like to use Net::IMAP::Simple::SSL to do it, this is the pacakge for you.

Included with this dist is CWEST's patch, the Net-IMAP-Simple-1.17.tar.gz, and
my own patches.
